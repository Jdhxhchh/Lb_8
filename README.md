1. WeatherData Class:
   - The `WeatherData` class represents a single weather observation for a specific date and station.
   - It has fields such as `date`, `stationId`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `precipitation`, and `windSpeed`.
   - The constructor initializes these fields with the provided values.

2. WeatherAnalysis Class:
   - The `WeatherAnalysis` class contains the main logic for fetching, analyzing, and displaying weather data.

3. fetchDataFromAPI Method:
   - The `fetchDataFromAPI` method is a placeholder for fetching real data from a meteorological API. For now, it returns test data.

4. findHottestStations Method:
   - The `findHottestStations` method takes a list of `WeatherData` objects and finds the top 2 stations with the highest average temperatures.
   - It uses Java Streams to sort the data based on temperature in descending order and then limits the result to the top 2.

5. findColdestStations Method:
   - The `findColdestStations` method is similar to `findHottestStations` but finds the top 2 stations with the lowest average temperatures.

6. findRainiestStations Method:
   - The `findRainiestStations` method finds the top 2 stations with the highest average precipitation using a similar approach.

7. displayResults Method:
   - The `displayResults` method takes a title (e.g., "Hottest Stations") and a list of weather data and prints the relevant information to the console.

8. main Method:
   - In the `main` method, test data is fetched using `fetchDataFromAPI`.
   - The hottest, coldest, and rainiest stations are found using respective methods.
   - Results for each category are displayed to the console.
